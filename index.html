      <h2>The True "About Me"?</h2>
      <p>I am usually not very keen on talking about myself out loud. So I made a site thats say that - let's talk
      about fun facts of animals! <br />Just try imagine my dating profile, lol. <br />I had an MS in construction management, but now it's only an expensive paper for me.
    <br />I love UI/UX design and data visualization. I look forward to learn d3.js some day soon!</p>
